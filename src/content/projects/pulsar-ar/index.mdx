# Summary

For the launch of the new Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z, the goal was to move beyond traditional print advertising and create a more engaging experience for a younger audience. The solution was an Augmented Reality (AR) campaign that brought the motorcycle to life.

The campaign was built using WebAR and the 8th Wall SDK, allowing users to scan a QR code on a print ad and instantly view an interactive 3D model of the motorcycle in their own environment, with no app download required.

# My Role

- I designed a clean, intuitive user interface that strictly adhered to Bajaj Pulsar's brand values and visual guidelines.
- I was responsible for the front-end implementation of this UI, integrating it directly with the 8th Wall SDK. This involved coding the interactive elements, ensuring they responded correctly to user input and effectively controlled the AR experience and 3D assets within the WebAR environment.
