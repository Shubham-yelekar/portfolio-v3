# User Journey

We designed a simple, mobile-first web experience to guide users through the process. The journey was designed to be quick, fun, and highly engaging.

**Take a Selfie :** The experience begins with the user taking a quick selfie directly through their browser.

**Personalize Your Swift :** Users then provide some basic information, such as gender and their preferred color for the new Swift.

**Submit & Confirm :** With a final click to confirm, the user's data is sent to our AI image generation engine.

**The Big Reveal :** A short while later, the user receives a message containing their personalized image—a high-quality picture of their face seamlessly integrated into a lifestyle shot of someone driving the new Swift.
