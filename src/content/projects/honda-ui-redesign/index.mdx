# Summary

Artificial Reality had built a platform using **Unreal Engine** and **Pixel Streaming** to deliver a photorealistic, real-time 3D car model directly to a user's web browser. The level of detail, from the paint's reflection to the dynamic light simulation, is better than any visualizer in India Market.

The frontend was built with Angular and Bootstrap, communicating with the Unreal Engine instance via WebRTC. While technologically impressive, the user interface (UI) needed a fresh perspective.

# Strategy

We also researched competing configurators and found that most relied on a strict, linear user flow. However, we wanted to avoid this rigid "checklist" approach, as we felt it would detract from the immersive quality of the visualizer.

Our design philosophy was to maintain a free-flowing and exploratory experience. This meant empowering the user to interact with any part of the car, in any order they wished, fostering a genuine sense of discovery and personal connection with the vehicle.

1. **Simplifing User Interface -** The existing interface had many options, but they weren't presented in the most intuitive way.

2. **Mobile Responsive -** The experience needed to be seamless and enjoyable on a smartphone, not just a scaled-down version of the desktop site.
3. **User Engagement -** We wanted to transform the experience from a passive viewing to an active, exciting exploration of the car.

## 1. Simplifing User Interface

My first goal was to declutter the interface by creating a clear hierarchy between major and minor interactions.

Through observation, I noticed a distinct user pattern: people almost always changed the **Car Variant** and **Color** before exploring smaller features.

Based on this insight, I redesigned the layout to give these high-frequency actions prominence, making them immediately visible when the visualizer loads.

  topImage={{
    src: "/pictures/honda-ui-new.jpg",
    alt: "Old UI ",
  }}
  bottomImage={{
    src: "/pictures/honda-ui-old.jpg",
    alt: "New UI",
  }}
/>

Furthermore, changing the variant directly impacts the price.

To make this relationship intuitive, the Variant selector and the price summary were redesigned to be closely associated.

Now, when a user selects a different model, the price updates instantly right beside it, providing clear, immediate feedbac

The old color button was getting lost with other icons.

I gave it a unique design and moved all the other options like 'open doors' and 'turn on lights'â€”into one simple dropdown menu.

  topImage={{
    src: "/pictures/colors-new.jpg",
    alt: "Old UI ",
  }}
  bottomImage={{
    src: "/pictures/colors-old.jpg",
    alt: "New UI",
  }}
/>

<ImageCarousal
  images={[
    {
      src: "/pictures/colors-ui.jpg",
      alt: "colors ui",
    },
    {
      src: "/pictures/scene-ui.jpg",
      alt: "scene ui",
    },
    {
      src: "/pictures/camera-ui.jpg",
      alt: "camera ui",
    },
    {
      src: "/pictures/ui-icons.jpg",
      alt: "icons ui",
    },
  ]}
/>
