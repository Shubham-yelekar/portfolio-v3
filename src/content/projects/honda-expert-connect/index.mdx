# Summary

Honda Expert Connect, an advanced direct-to-customer platform that brings the showroom experience directly to the user, wherever they are.

The vision was to allow a customer to instantly connect with a Honda expert for a live, one-on-one video consultation. During the call, the expert could guide the customer through the photorealistic 3D car model, demonstrating features in real-time and answering questions, creating a truly guided and personal tour.

# User interface

My design process covered everything from high-level user flows to the pixel-perfect details that create a seamless experience.

Interactive UI buttons, forms, live-chat windows, and the overall layouts for both the customer and expert dashboards.

# Mic permision modals

A key challenge was the microphone permission step. I designed specific modals with custom instructions and visuals tailored for different browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, ensuring a smooth start for all users.

# Frontend of Expert's App

My frontend responsibilities extended to the Expert application, where I designed and built crucial components.

This involved developing dynamic lead generation forms for capturing customer data, as well as crafting the interface that experts used to manage calls, demonstrate features, and track customer engagement.

# Expert Connect Webpage

Beyond the core application, I also designed the official Expert Connect webpage on Honda's main website. This served as the initial touchpoint for customers, providing information about the service and guiding them seamlessly to the live consultation platform

# Conclusions

It has been a privilege to contribute to a project that has undergone significant evolution over many months, with each iteration directly informed by business goals and a drive to optimize user engagement.

Today, this platform is a core asset for Honda, consistently proving its effectiveness in both initial lead creation and the final stages of closing deals.

This journey offered me a profound understanding of how meticulous UI/frontend work translates into measurable business success and plays a critical role in a company's direct-to-customer strategy.
