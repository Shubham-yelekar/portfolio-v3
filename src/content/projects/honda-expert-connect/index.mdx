# Summary

Honda Expert Connect, an advanced direct-to-customer platform that brings the showroom experience directly to the user, wherever they are.

The vision was to allow a customer to instantly connect with a Honda expert for a live, one-on-one video consultation. During the call, the expert could guide the customer through the photorealistic 3D car model, demonstrating features in real-time and answering questions, creating a truly guided and personal tour.

## User interface

Cross-Browser Compatibility: A key challenge was the microphone permission step. I designed specific modals with custom instructions and visuals tailored for different browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, ensuring a smooth and non-confusing start for all users.
