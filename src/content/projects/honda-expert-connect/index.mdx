# Summary

Artificial Reality had built a platform using **Unreal Engine** and **Pixel Streaming** to deliver a photorealistic, real-time 3D car model directly to a user's web browser. The level of detail, from the paint's reflection to the dynamic light simulation, is better than any visualizer in India Market.

The frontend was built with Angular and Bootstrap, communicating with the Unreal Engine instance via WebRTC. While technologically impressive, the user interface (UI) needed a fresh perspective.
