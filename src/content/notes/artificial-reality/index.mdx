### Summary

Artificial Reality had built a platform using **Unreal Engine** and **Pixel Streaming** to deliver a photorealistic, real-time 3D car model directly to a user's web browser. The level of detail, from the paint's reflection to the dynamic light simulation, is better any visualizer in India Market.

The frontend was built with Angular and Bootstrap, communicating with the Unreal Engine instance via WebRTC. While technologically impressive, the user interface (UI) needed a fresh perspective.

### Strategy

- **Simplify the UI:** The existing interface had many options, but they weren't presented in the most intuitive way.
- **Increase User Engagement:** We wanted to transform the experience from a passive viewing to an active, exciting exploration of the car.
- **Create a Better Mobile Version:** The experience needed to be seamless and enjoyable on a smartphone, not just a scaled-down version of the desktop site.

We also researched competing configurators and found that most relied on a strict, linear user flow. However, we wanted to avoid this rigid "checklist" approach, as we felt it would detract from the immersive quality of the visualizer. Our design philosophy was to maintain a free-flowing and exploratory experience. This meant empowering the user to interact with any part of the car, in any order they wished, fostering a genuine sense of discovery and personal connection with the vehicle

#### Simplify the UI

- I saw that everyone changed the **Color** and **Model** first, so I put those controls front and center.

    alt: "Old UI ",
  }}
  bottomImage={{
    src: "/pictures/honda-ui-old.jpg",
    alt: "New UI",
  }}
/>

- To make pricing clear, I put the price right next to the model selector. When you choose a new model, the price updates instantly.

- The old color button was getting lost with other icons. I gave it a unique design and moved all the other options like 'open doors' and 'turn on lights'â€”into one simple dropdown menu.

    alt: "New UI",
  }}
/>
