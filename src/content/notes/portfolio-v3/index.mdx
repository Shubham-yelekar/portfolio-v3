My old site served its purpose, but it wasn't a true reflection of my current skills or my aspirations as a "Design Engineer." The final push, however, didn't come from just a feeling—it came from data.

After checking the analytics for my last portfolio, I found a significant drop-off rate right after the homepage. Visitors would land, but they wouldn't explore. This realization sparked a complete rethink.

# Inspiration

This entire process was heavily inspired by the incredible work of others. I've been studying portfolios from designers and engineers like [Chanhdai](https://chanhdai.com/), [Jakub Krehel](https://jakub.kr/), [Daniel Maslan](https://www.daniels.link/) , and [Abhijeet Singh](https://www.abjt.dev/). I was particularly struck by Chanhdai's clear focus on the "Design Engineer" role and the meticulous detailing in his MDX blogs. And, of course, the work of pioneers like [Rauno Freiberg](https://rauno.me/) and [Maxime Heckel](https://maximeheckel.com/) always serves as a benchmark for quality.

This new portfolio is more than just an update. It’s a new foundation, built on a clearer strategy and with a sharper focus on blending design with technical implementation. I'm excited to see where it goes from here.
