My role as a **Frontend Developer at** [Artificial Reality]("/notes/artificial-reality") ignited my passion for the **"Design Engineer" role.** It combined my love for \*\*pixel-perfect UI design, obsessive detailing, and full agency over implementation. I actively took on UI/UX tasks—from competitive analysis to rapid prototyping—and directly implemented those designs, seeing features through their complete lifecycle.

This latest iteration of my portfolio is a direct manifestation of this journey. It's built to showcase not just my frontend development prowess, but equally my strong capabilities in UI/UX design. It highlights projects where I've had significant agency over both the creative vision and its technical realization. It's a statement that I'm not just a developer, and not just a designer—I'm a Design Engineer, committed to bringing beautiful, functional, and deeply considered digital experiences to life.\*\*
